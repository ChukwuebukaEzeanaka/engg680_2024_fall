The model performs well on both the primary test set (X_test, y_test) and the first independent test set (X1, y1), achieving accuracies of **96% and 92%**, respectively.

However, on the second independent test set (X2, y2), the model's accuracy drops drastically to 25%, with poor classification performance across all classes except for predicting the turn class.

(4 marks)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RsrwlbkbbJ0K"},"source":["#### 2.1.4 Answer\n","### Which Model is a Better Fit? Section 1 vs. Section 2\n","\n","#### Section 1 Performance:\n","The model from Section 1 performs exceptionally well. It achieves a high test accuracy of **96%**, with strong performance across all motion states (`rest`, `straight`, and `turn`). The confusion matrix shows very few misclassifications, and the precision, recall, and F1-scores are consistently high for each class.\n","\n","Additionally, the cross-validation results are impressive, with a **perfect train score of 1.00** and a **validation score of 0.95**. This means the model not only fits the training data well but also generalizes effectively to new, unseen data. The comprehensive feature set used in Section 1 gives the model the ability to accurately predict the motion states, making it highly reliable.\n","\n","#### Section 2 Performance:\n","In contrast, the model from Section 2 shows more moderate performance, with a test accuracy of **83%**. While it performs decently for the `rest` motion state, its performance for `straight` and `turn` states drops significantly. For instance, the `turn` class has a recall of only **55%**, meaning the model struggles to correctly identify many instances of this class.\n","\n","The cross-validation scores tell a similar story, with a **train score of 0.84** and a **validation score of 0.82**. These results suggest that the model isn't capturing the data patterns as effectively as the Section 1 model. The smaller feature set in Section 2 likely limits the model's ability to distinguish between motion states accurately, especially for more complex cases like `turn`.\n","\n","#### Conclusion:\n","The **Section 1 model** is clearly the better fit. It provides higher accuracy, better balance across all classes, and generalizes well to new data. On the other hand, the Section 2 model, with its reduced feature set, struggles to perform as effectively, particularly for more challenging motion states. This highlights the importance of using a rich set of features to build a robust and accurate model.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"g_jQnodLbJ0K"},"source":["___"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QXZw0fQmbJ0L"},"source":["### 2.2 - Model Evaluation on Test Datasets 1 and 2 (7 Marks)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7W24UbwhbJ0L"},"source":["___"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JhBjllPzbJ0L"},"source":["#### 2.2.1 - Extract selected features and targets from test datasets"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lHB1bFCQbJ0L"},"source":["The model trained in 2.1 is to be tested on the independent datasets, that is test_set1 and test_set2.\n","Seperate the testsets into the selected features and target vectors *(X1, y1)* and (X2,)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"aW643Y3gbJ0L","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1732847900897,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":86,"user":{"displayName":"Chukwuebuka Ezeanaka","userId":"09509436325072514432"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO - Load the target vector from test_set1 into y1, and the selected features from test_set1 into X1\n","# (1 marks)\n","y1 = test_set1['motion_state']\n","X1 = test_set1[selected_features]\n","X1.head(2)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_rWaBWWFbJ0M","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1732847900898,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":87,"user":{"displayName":"Chukwuebuka Ezeanaka","userId":"09509436325072514432"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO - Load the target vector from test_set2 into y2, and the selected features from test_set2 into X2\n","y2 = test_set2['motion_state']\n","X2 = test_set2[selected_features]\n","X2.head(2)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YBxmJpKabJ0M"},"source":["___"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iYjZYXd0bJ0M"},"source":["#### 2.2.2 - Visualize Results"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qFUsMAN5bJ0M"},"source":["For each test dataset, print the test set accuracy score."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"pdxP-CnIbJ0N","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1732847900898,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":86,"user":{"displayName":"Chukwuebuka Ezeanaka","userId":"09509436325072514432"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO - Print test score accuracies for test_set1 and test_set2\n","\n","# Refit the pipeline on the selected training data\n","pipeline_selected.fit(X_train[selected_features], y_train)\n","\n","# Prediction using the trained model on the independent test sets\n","y_pred_test1 = pipeline_selected.predict(X1)\n","y_pred_test2 = pipeline_selected.predict(X2)\n","\n","# Calculate accuracy for both test sets\n","accuracy_test1 = accuracy_score(y1, y_pred_test1)\n","accuracy_test2 = accuracy_score(y2, y_pred_test2)\n","\n","# Print the test set accuracy scores\n","print(\"test_set1 score: {:.2f}\".format(accuracy_test1))\n","print(\"test_set2 score: {:.2f}\".format(accuracy_test2))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wmrC321wbJ0N"},"source":["Display the confusion matrix and print the classification for test_set 1 *(X1, y1)*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"tdk7FqxDbJ0N","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1732847900898,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":85,"user":{"displayName":"Chukwuebuka Ezeanaka","userId":"09509436325072514432"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO - Display confusion matrix and print classification report for (X1, y1)\n","conf_matrix_test1 = confusion_matrix(y1, y_pred_test1)\n","class_report_test1 = classification_report(y1, y_pred_test1)\n","\n","# Print the classification report\n","print(\"Confusion Matrix for test_set1:\\n\", conf_matrix_test1)\n","print(\"\\nClassification Report:\\n\", class_report_test1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tqMtZT98bJ0N"},"source":["Display the confusion matrix and print the classification for test_set 2 *(X2, y2)*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"QlWxkJeUbJ0N","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1732847900899,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":86,"user":{"displayName":"Chukwuebuka Ezeanaka","userId":"09509436325072514432"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO - Display confusion matrix and print classification report for (X2, y2)\n","conf_matrix_test2 = confusion_matrix(y2, y_pred_test2)\n","class_report_test2 = classification_report(y2, y_pred_test2)\n","\n","# Print the classification report\n","print(\"Confusion Matrix for test_set2:\\n\", conf_matrix_test2)\n","print(\"\\nClassification Report:\\n\", class_report_test2)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HJpu-0F1bJ0N"},"source":["___"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tWGJkS-BbJ0N"},"source":["#### 2.2.3 Questions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9cCFTICnbJ0O"},"source":["1.
