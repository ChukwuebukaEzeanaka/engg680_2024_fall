This project focuses on implementing an image-based obstacle detection system for autonomous vehicles using monocular cameras. The main objective is to develop an object detection solution that can recognize various obstacles in real-time using deep learning models. The system will be tested using the KITTI dataset and will apply techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify obstacles and improve detection accuracy
